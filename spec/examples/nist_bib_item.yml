abstract:
- content: The NISTIR 8011 volumes each focus on an individual information security capability, adding tangible detail to the more general overview given in NISTIR 8011 Volume 1, and providing a template for transition to a detailed, NIST guidance-based automated assessment. This document, Volume 3 of NISTIR 8011, addresses the Software Asset Management (SWAM) information security capability. The focus of the SWAM capability is to manage risk created by unmanaged or unauthorized software on a network. Unmanaged or unauthorized software is a target that attackers can use as a platform from which to attack components on the network.
